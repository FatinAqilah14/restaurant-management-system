# Restaurant Management System

This software will help in automating the tedious task of table reservations in restaurants, which when manually done may lead to inconsistencies and unnecessary work. With the help of this software a customer can book a table at a restaurant on a given date, the customer will be provided with a list of available time slots and customer can choose any suitable time slot. This software will handle all slot, table and date management and hence remove any scope of human error. This software will also help keep track of daily income and customers. This project is prepared by Soumya Banerjee as a part of Continuous Assessment (CA-2).
